## About The Project

This repository serves as a personal collection of solved exercises from the **"Praticando Python"** learning path offered by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and demonstrate the practical application of various Python concepts, ranging from fundamental syntax to more advanced topics. Each script represents a solution to a specific challenge proposed during the courses.

## Topics Covered

The exercises in this repository span across several key areas of Python programming, including:

* **Fundamentals:** Basic syntax, data types, and logic.
* **Strings and Regular Expressions (Regex):** Text manipulation and pattern matching.
* **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Concepts of `async` and `await`.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is intended for reference and demonstration purposes. You can browse the different `.py` files to see my approach to solving various programming challenges. There is no central application to run; each file is a self-contained exercise solution.
